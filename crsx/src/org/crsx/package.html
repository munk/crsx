	CRSX is the <em>Combinatory Reduction Systems with Extensions</em> framework.
	<p>
	It is an implementation of higher order rewriting based on
	Klop's Combinatory Reduction System (CRS) formalism, with a sort system that
	allows working with fully sorted <em>Contraction Systems</em>. 
	<p>
	CRSX is especially suited for developing compilers, and comes with a frontend called
	HACS, <em>Higher-order Attribute Contraction Systems</em> with special support for
	teaching and developing compilers.
	<p>
	For the moment (spring 2014), CRSX has been used to develop compilers for medium sized languages
	(XQuery and JSONiq)
	whereas HACS is used to teach and implement small language compilers.
