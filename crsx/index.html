<h2>CRSX - Combinatory Reduction Systems with Extensions</h2>

<p>
  <b>CRSX</b> is the <em>Combinatory Reduction Systems with Extensions</em>
  framework.

  It is an implementation of higher order rewriting based on Klop's
  Combinatory Reduction System (CRS) formalism, with a sort system
  that allows working with fully sorted <em>Contraction Systems</em>.

  <b>CRSX</b> is especially suited for developing compilers, and comes with a
  frontend called <b>HACS</b>, <em>Higher-order Attribute Contraction
  Systems</em> with special support for teaching and developing
  compilers.

  For the moment, <b>CRSX</b> has been used to develop compilers for medium
  sized languages
  (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ibmdatapower/ibm-datapower-appliances-whats-new-in-2013">XQuery and JSONiq</a>)
  whereas <b>HACS</b> is used to
  <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring14/CSCI-GA.2130-001/">teach</a>
  as well as implement small experimental language compilers.
<p>
  <b>CRSX</b> is maintained in two locations:
  <ul>

    <li>The main development of <b>CRSX</b> and <b>HACS</b> happens in the
      <a href="http://github.com/crsx">GitHub crsx organization</a>.

    <li>Historical versions as well as crsx-related publications can be found on the
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/crsx">SourceForge project page</a>.

  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>
  The goals of the CRSX project (not all have been reached) are to
  <ul>
    <li>provide a <em>generic higher-order rewrite engine</em> that
    <li>is easy to <em>embed</em> in and <em>integrate with</em> other projects, specifically optimizing compiler,
    <li>is simple to <em>extend</em> with experimental features,
    <li>runs on the universally available Java 5+ platform, and
    <li>can generate executables for any platform.
  </ul>
  Everyone can use the code but if you wish to contribute then please contact the project admins.

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
  Combinatory Reduction Systems (CRS) were invented by
  <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/%7Ejwk/">J. W. Klop</a> in 1980 based
  on ideas in a
  <a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/REWRITING/MISC/AGeneralChurch-RosserTheorem.pdf">note by Peter Aczel</a>.

  The motivating idea of CRS was to allow rewriting rules that can match
  binding constructs and perform substitutions as part of rewrite
  steps.  The seminal paper on CRS is:
  <blockquote>Jan Willem Klop, Vincent van Oostrom, and Femke van Raamsdonk,
    <q>Combinatory Reduction Systems: Introduction and Survey,</q>
    <em>Theoretical Computer Science</em> <strong>121</strong>,
    pp. 271-308 (1993).
  </blockquote>
<p>
  The <b>CRSX</b> project is an extended reimplementation of the Haskell
  program (<q>CRSX 1</q>) in chapter 6 of
  <blockquote>
    Kristoffer H. Rose,
    <em>Operational Reduction Models for Functional Programming Languages</em>,
    Ph.D. thesis, DIKU, University of Copenhagen, 1996
    (<a href="http://krisrose.net/thesis.pdf">pdf</a>).
  </blockquote>
  The second version (<q>CRSX 2</q>) was part of the XQuery optimizer used in the
  <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/virtualxml">Virtual XML
  project</a> at IBM Research from 2005.  The current production
  version (<q>CRSX 3</q>) was a full rewrite starting in 2007 with a
  compiler generator to native code used to implement the IBM
  DataPower appliance
  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ibmdatapower/ibm-datapower-appliances-whats-new-in-2013">XQuery and JSONiq</a>
  compilers.
<p>
  Since 2013, <b>CRSX</b> development centers on <q>CRSX 4</q>, which
  integrates the <b>HACS</b> compiler generator frontend with the goal
  of supporting larger compilers.
